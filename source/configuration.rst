Configuration
==============

Configure Kanao by modifying the `config.ini` file. The configuration file includes various settings for the chatbot and modules. Here's an example configuration:

```ini
[OpenAI]
API_KEY = your_openai_api_key

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.
